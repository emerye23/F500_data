## About this project
This website was created as my final project for [Kaneâ€™s Free Data Science Course](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/). I loved this course and would recommend it to anybody that wants to learn about Data Science!

## About Me
My name is Rajarshi Mandal, and I am a student at William Diamond Middle School. The code for this project can be found at [my Github account](https://github.com/rajarshi-mandal).

## Sources

The data was scraped from [fortune.com](fortune.com) and uploaded to [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/garrethlee/fortune-500-companies-dataset) by Garreth Lee on June 15, 2023 in a .csv file. After being cleaned, the final dataset was uploaded back to [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/fortune-500-companies) for others to use.
